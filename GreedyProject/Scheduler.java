   // Postconditions: 
   // 1. The returned array must be sorted by increasing starting time.  It
   // may be null.
   // 2. Time ranges within it may overlap, but there may be no
   // gaps within the toCover time range (at least one returned time range
   // must cover all times within toCover).
   // 3. The employees array passed in must not be altered.
