Java Algorithms: CPE 349
=================================

A sample of some of the conceptually tougher code I've written.  Algorithms include:
 - An O(n^3) to O(n^2) optimization problem
 - A Greedy algorithm proof.
 - The Knapsack problem, implemented as a Greedy algorithm.
 - The Knapsack problem, implemented as a Dynamic Programming algorithm.
 - The Knapsack problem, implemented as a Branch & Bound algorithm.
